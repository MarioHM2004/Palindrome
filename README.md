# Palindrome

This project finds such iterated reversal palindromes, and the smallest number of iterations,
in order to get a palindromic number, given the constraints on this number of iterations.

USAGE
./palindrome -n number -p palindrome [-b base] [-imin i] [-imax i]

DESCRIPTION

-n n integer to be transformed (>=0)
-p pal palindromic number to be obtained (incompatible with the -n
option) (>=0)
if defined, all fitting values of n will be output
-b base base in which the procedure will be executed (1<b<=10)
-imin i minimum number of iterations, included (>=0)
-imax i maximum number of iterations, included (>=0)
